# PedalApp

- Android app developed for bikers -
this app is a proof of concept in order to realize an app using geographical shared data and open source maps.
It makes uses of:
* GraphHopper (https://graphhopper.com/) - API for route planning (many tanks to Peter Karich for the free key);
* LeafLet (http://leafletjs.com/) - A javascript library for maps management. (here wrapped into an Android Webview)
